A game with neurointerface based on EEG - sensors.
 
This project's goal is to help people with paresis. People with health limitations can develop their hands.

This project includes:

1.Arduino sketch. (To get and process EEG - signal).
2.Game, designed on Python. (You also can play, without EEG-sensors).

EEG-sensors were provided by Bitronics Studio. Connection's scheme are in Arduino sketch. You can see the result of the work on https://vk.com/video507970934_456239190
